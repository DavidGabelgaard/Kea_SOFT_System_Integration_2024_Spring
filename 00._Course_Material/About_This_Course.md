Introducing the tools
Teams: Communication and hand-ins.
This Repo: Code, slides, assignment descriptions. 


Feel free to make PRs. This is the reason why I’ve defined a lot of the material in Git.


Bred viden om mange ting (modsat dyb viden om få ting).

The basics for every topic:
What is it? What is the theory behind it?
What does it aim to solve?
How is it an improvement over other things (pros)?
What complications and downsides does it introduce (cons)? 
For which use cases would it be a good choice?
This isn’t all there is to know but if you can answer these things then you have a good foundation.



Reflection level, ramme for uddannelsen, ability to find information yourselves rather than currated content



Learning goals: They will tell you how much you are expected to know about a topic and in what way. 



Why research the topics if we are going to talk about them in class anyway?
- You will be able to develop your own metaphors and ways to understand the course material first.
- You get to process the material multiple times. This shortens the time you need to review the topics prior to the exam. 
- You can participate in class. Saying things out loud in front of people helps you remember the material. 


Why both Node.js and Python.


Contrast and compare. Helps point out what is the core of the topic rather than just syntax and language specific implementation. 
You are allowed to create your own examples in other languages. 


The exam, you are allowed to come to the exam with my code but you still need to understand it. Based on limited data I can state that students that create their own version of the code have performed better during the code part of the exam.
