# 02a [Individual] Data format translation servers - Part II

This is a continuation of the assignment: File formats bonanza!.

Create a single server (this week you can start with one) in vanilla REST. Create endpoints that read the files that you created last week, parse them and send them as response. You must figure out what data format to send as response.

You are allowed to split the responsibility between the servers if you are pressed for time. I.e. ServerA reads XML, CSV. ServerB reads YAML, TXT, JSON.

Next week you will create another server in another language.
