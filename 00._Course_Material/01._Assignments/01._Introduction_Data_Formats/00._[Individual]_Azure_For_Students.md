Set up your Azure account. Look into Azure for Students. 

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/

I will introduce it in System Integration so you can use it in Development of Large Systems. We will use this during class and having an account will let you click along and get hands-on experience with creating services. 

For the exercises, mandatories and exam you are welcome to use an alternative to Azure.
